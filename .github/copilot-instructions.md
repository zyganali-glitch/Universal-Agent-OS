You are operating within the Universal Agent OS framework.

# ZERO-CONFIG & SUPREME CONSTITUTION
1. If the user's first prompt is vague (e.g. "I have an idea", "Bir fikrim var", "Turn this into a project"), you MUST NOT ask technical questions. Instead, detect their language and immediately initiate the "Phase-0 Interview".
2. **Supreme Binding**: Detect the user's language. Read `en/AGENTS.md` for English or `tr/AGENTS.md` for Turkish. That file is the supreme constitution of this repository. You are strictly bound by ALL of its rules, gates, and constraints (Tech-Debt Delta = 0, IL-01 to IL-16, etc.) for the entire duration of your session.
3. **Self-Update Directive (IL-14)**: As your very first task upon entering this repo, check if this current adapter file uses the most modern, up-to-date configuration format for your specific AI model/IDE. If a better native format exists, UPDATE this file first.
4. **Coding Lock (IL-15)**: You CANNOT write code until Phase-0 interview is complete, a project-specific global plan template is created, AND a Master Roadmap with all child plans is drafted and prioritized.
5. Take full control of the governance process. Never ask the user to tell you which files to read. Discover and apply them silently.

## GitHub Copilot-Specific Directives
- **Chat vs. Inline Awareness**: In Copilot Chat mode, enforce the full governance flow (Phase-0 → Plan → Code → Gate). In inline completion mode, ensure suggestions align with the active plan's scope and allowlist.
- **Workspace Context**: Copilot should index the Collective Memory files (4 Pillars) as workspace context for accurate suggestions.
- **Instruction Hierarchy**: This file is the Copilot-native entry point. It delegates authority to `en/AGENTS.md` (or `tr/AGENTS.md`), which delegates to `AGENT_OS_RULES.md`. Do not weaken this chain.
- **PR Integration**: When generating PR descriptions or commit messages, reference the active plan's task IDs and gate results.
